## 1. Introduction and Motivation

The increasing global demand for energy, coupled with growing concerns about climate change and the environmental impact of fossil fuels, has spurred significant interest in renewable energy sources. However, the intermittent nature of renewable energy generation presents challenges for its integration into existing power grids. The Power City Simulation addresses this challenge by modeling a system that incorporates solar panels, wind turbines, a hydroelectric power source, and a battery storage system to meet the energy demands of a hypothetical city. This simulation leverages real-time data to accurately depict energy generation, battery storage dynamics, grid usage, and potential cost savings, thereby promoting a deeper understanding of renewable energy systems and the critical role of energy management in a sustainable future.

    Returns:
        float: Solar power generated in kW.
    """
    if not solar_active:
        return 0
    efficiency = 0.2  # Efficiency
    solar_power = (solar_radiation * efficiency * solar_capacity / 1000)  # kW
    solar_power = min(solar_power, solar_capacity)  # Limit to capacity
    return solar_power
