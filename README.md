## **1. Introduction**

The **Energy Distribution Program** is an advanced Python-based application that models renewable energy systems, including hydroelectric, solar, and wind power generation. The program integrates user-defined parameters and simulated environmental data to calculate energy outputs, display trends in real-time visualizations, and analyze financial savings. Designed with flexibility, the application demonstrates the interplay between procedural, object-oriented, and event-driven programming paradigms.

This software is informed by the principles of energy modeling and simulation as outlined by leading research institutions (Fraunhofer Institute, 2020; US Department of Energy, 2020). It showcases how algorithmic design can bridge theoretical models with practical, user-friendly implementations.

The algorithms employed in the program aim to balance computational efficiency, scalability, and real-world applicability. They rely on principles from energy systems modeling, ensuring that outputs reflect realistic scenarios (Knuth, 1997).

### **6.2 Algorithms in the Program**

#### **Weather Simulation Algorithm**
Generates random environmental conditions for modeling variability:
```python
def simulate_weather():
    temperature = random.uniform(15, 35)  # Temperature in Celsius
    wind_speed = random.uniform(0, 20)   # Wind speed in m/s
    solar_radiation = random.uniform(200, 1000)  # Solar radiation in W/m²
    return temperature, wind_speed, solar_radiation
```
- **Purpose**: Introduces stochastic variability to represent natural weather changes.

#### **Energy Calculation Algorithms**
1. **Hydroelectric Power**:
   ```python
   def simulate_hydroelectricity(rainfall, hydro_capacity):
       return rainfall * hydro_capacity
   ```
   **Assumption**: Energy output is proportional to rainfall and system efficiency.

2. **Solar Power**:
   ```python
   def simulate_solar_power(solar_radiation, solar_capacity, panel_efficiency):
       return solar_radiation * solar_capacity * panel_efficiency
   ```
   **Key Parameters**: Solar radiation and efficiency values derived from industry standards.

3. **Wind Power**:
   ```python
   def simulate_wind_power(wind_speed, wind_capacity, turbine_efficiency):
       return wind_speed ** 3 * wind_capacity * turbine_efficiency
   ```

#### **Cost and Savings Analysis Algorithm**
Calculates the financial benefits of integrating renewable energy systems:
```python
def calculate_savings(grid_usage, grid_cost, baseline_cost):
    grid_usage_cost = grid_usage * grid_cost
    return baseline_cost - grid_usage_cost
```
- **Output**: Quantifies monetary savings from reduced reliance on grid electricity.
